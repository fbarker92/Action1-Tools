However, this does not guarantee that the endpoints have received or processed it. Do not call it too frequently as this will put an extra CPU load on your endpoints (depending on the complexity of the report's data source).\nEndpoints that are currently connected will begin the requery process almost immediately, typically within a few seconds. Should any endpoints be disconnected or turned off when the request is made, they will process it once they are back online.\nTo verify the current status of a data row, refer to the \"response_type\" attribute within the ReportRow object, which can be retrieved using /reportdata . The object structure is as follows:\n\n```\n{\n  \"type\": \"ReportRow\",\n  \"response_type\": \"cache/live\"\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nA \"response_type\" value of \"live\" indicates that the data is current and reflects the results of the most recent requery request. Conversely, a \"response_type\" of \"cache\" suggests that the endpoint has yet to update its data to reflect the latest request.\n",

Additionally, when software is installed or uninstalled with Action1, the inventory is updated immediately. Use this method only if you need the most current real-time data or when software was installed or uninstalled without Action1 and you don't want to wait 15 minutes. Do not call it too frequently as this will put an extra CPU load on your endpoints.\n\nWhen the method returns a successful status (200), it indicates that the requery request has been placed in the queue. However, this does not guarantee that the endpoints have received or processed it. Endpoints that are currently connected will begin the requery process almost immediately, typically within a few seconds. Should any endpoints be disconnected or turned off when the request is made, they will process it once they are back online.\nTo verify the current status of a data row referring to an installed application, refer to the \"response_type\" attribute within the ReportRow object, which can be retrieved using '/installed-software/{orgId}/data'. The object structure is as follows:\n\n```\n{\n  \"type\": \"ReportRow\",\n  \"response_type\": \"cache/live\"\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nA \"response_type\" value of \"live\" indicates that the data is current and reflects the results of the most recent requery request. Conversely, a \"response_type\" of \"cache\" suggests that the endpoint has yet to update its data to reflect the latest request.\n",

        "description": "**Requires one of the following permissions: `view_installed_software`, `view_endpoints`**\n\nThis API method initiates an asynchronous update (\"requery\") of the installed software inventory for the specified endpoint.\n\nNote that installed software inventory is updated automatically every 15 minutes or less if any changes to software are detected.  Additionally, when software is installed or uninstalled with Action1, the inventory is updated immediately. Use this method only if you need the most current real-time data or when software was installed or uninstalled without Action1 and you don't want to wait 15 minutes. Do not call it too frequently as this will put an extra CPU load on your endpoints.\n\nWhen the method returns a successful status (200), it indicates that the requery request has been placed in the queue. However, this does not guarantee that the endpoints have received or processed it. Endpoint that are currently connected will begin the requery process almost immediately, typically within a few seconds. Should endpoint be disconnected or turned off when the request is made, they will process it once they are back online.\nTo verify the current status of a data row referring to an installed application, refer to the \"response_type\" attribute within the ReportRow object, which can be retrieved using '/installed-software/{orgId}/data'. The object structure is as follows:\n\n```\n{\n  \"type\": \"ReportRow\",\n  \"response_type\": \"cache/live\"\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nA \"response_type\" value of \"live\" indicates that the data is current and reflects the results of the most recent requery request. Conversely, a \"response_type\" of \"cache\" suggests that the endpoint has yet to update its data to reflect the latest request.\n",
